# About halfh

This human is an internet enthusiast.  
He prefers to create things that live in the browser.  
His name is Tom & he likes his cat, reading, cloud watching and many more things...

## For me it started as with any young child.  
# Curiosity.

I was very curious when I first got internet access on my PC. Reading websites was interesting, downloading content from the internet was exciting.  
Consuming people's creations through the World Wide Web, as it was called back then, was exhilarating.  
And pretty soon I wanted to create and publish on the internet as well.
