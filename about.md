# About halfh

This human is an internet enthusiast.  
He prefers to create things that live in the browser.  
His name is Tom & he likes his cat, reading, cloud watching and many more things...

# Curiosity.

I was very curious when I first got internet access on my PC.  
Reading websites was interesting, downloading content from the internet was exciting.  
Consuming people's creations through the World Wide Web, as it was called back then, was exhilarating.  
And pretty soon I wanted to create and publish on the internet as well.  

# The start

I started with simple things, HTML. Made websites for myself and friends. 
They were simple creations. But pretty soon I noticed something lacking. __*interactivity*__  
I started playing around with javascript. Making things move, on the static web pages, was the __eureka__ moment for me.

# Education

I went for it, followed my dream of building web pages. Went to computer oriented schools.  
Where I learned programming, database design, Information technology systems design and many other things.

# Self learning & staying true to my initial dreams

But regardless of what I was thought, I always stayed current withing my chosen field.  
Building websites. Along the way I found CSS & it has slowly taken over my favorite part of web development.
If javascript can bring content to the webpage and manipulate it in interesting ways. Than CSS can make it look however you want it to look.

# now

I make things that live in the browser. Wether it be in the mobile ones or desktop ones.  

I've gathered my skills, got my experience & now I help develop products for others.  
 
## I can do these for you

You want something that represents you or your brand on the internet.  
__I can make that.__  
You want something to control your daily process & show you statistics and buttons on your personal control panel.  
__I can make that too.__  
You want something for your personal life, to display and aggregate your whole digital presence in one spot.  
__Mhmm, can be done.__
