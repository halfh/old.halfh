title: Tabby terminal for windows
---

I remember using cmder for a while on windows. It was a great looking terminal.  
Sadly it was very slow to load and to work with.

## Looking for a terminal for windows

I tried out `Windows Terminal` the new terminal from microsoft. It's great compared to the base `cmd` & `Powershell`. But it's customization leaves a lot to be desired.

## So on I went, looking for more

I found out about `Tabby`, and Electron based terminal app. It's cross platform, so if for some reason I want the same terminal on all my different operating systems, I can have the same terminal everywhere.
